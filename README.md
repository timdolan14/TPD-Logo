## Description 
This project creates an SVG logo generator that prompts the user with four questions using the Inquirer.js package. The first question asks for the text that will be included in the logo, the second question asks for the primary color of the logo, the third question asks for the color of the logo shape, and the fourth question asks for the shape of the logo.

Once the user fills out these questions, the SVG logo generator automatically generates an SVG logo directly within Visual Studio Code (VSC). The resulting SVG logo is saved in a file called "logo.svg", which the user can then view in VSC.

This project is useful for designers or developers who want to quickly generate SVG logos for their projects without the need for a dedicated graphic design tool. It simplifies the process by automating the creation of SVG logos, saving time and effort. The use of the Inquirer.js package also makes the process more interactive and user-friendly.
